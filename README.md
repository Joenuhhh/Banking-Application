  <li><strong>MVC Architecture:</strong> The application follows the MVC architectural pattern, separating concerns into Models (data), Views (presentation), and Controllers (logic). This separation enhances maintainability, scalability, and code organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Agile Methodology:</strong> The development of the Banking Application adheres to the Agile methodology, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Agile practices such as user stories, sprints, and regular feedback are incorporated into the development process.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deployment:</h2>
<p>The Banking Application is deployed on Azure, utilizing Azure App Service for hosting the ASP.NET MVC application. Additionally, an Azure SQL Database is integrated with the application to store and manage banking-related data.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ASP.NET MVC:</strong> The backend of the application is developed using the ASP.NET MVC framework, providing a structured approach to building web applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Azure:</strong> The application is hosted on the Azure cloud platform, leveraging services such as Azure App Service for deployment and Azure SQL Database for data storage.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL Database:</strong> Azure SQL Database is used to store and manage banking-related data, including information about accounts, transactions, customers, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>C#:</strong> The application is primarily developed in C#, the programming language used for building ASP.NET applications.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> Frontend components of the application are developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>To access the Banking Application, navigate to the deployed URL on Azure. Upon accessing the application, users can perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, making transactions, viewing account details, and managing customer information.</p>
